# Tableau-Data-Visualization-coronavirus
Hello there, this dashboard shows the global trend of COVID-19 cases, from Jan to June 2020, including total no. of confirmed cases, total no. of lost lives, and top 10 countries with confirmed cases and confirmed deaths. It was built using Tableau on 6 January, 2021 for practice purpose.

Data was downloaded from https://data.world/covid-19-data-resource-hub/covid-19-case-counts/workspace/file?filename=COVID-19+Activity.csv, which was compiled on 5 June, 2020.

Any comments or suggestions to improve this dashboard further are welcome. I am be reached at kckc2020123@gmail.com
